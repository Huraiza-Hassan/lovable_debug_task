## Overview

This document outlines the major bugs that were discovered and resolved in the  
Lead Management System

---

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Duplicate Email Sending

**File**: `LeadCaptureForm.tsx` (lines 30–66)  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem

Confirmation email was being sent twice to users due to the function being invoked in two places.

#### Root Cause

Redundant function invocation without any conditional check or state flag.

#### Fix

Removed the second function call and ensured the confirmation logic runs only once.

#### Impact

- ✅ Single email per submission
- ✅ No duplicate leads in CRM
- ✅ Improved user trust

---

### 2. State Management Bug

**File**: `LeadCaptureForm.tsx`  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem

Mixed local state with Zustand store caused desynchronized data in the UI.

#### Root Cause

Inconsistent state handling between local component state and global store.

#### Fix

Refactored the component to exclusively use the Zustand `addLead` method for updates.

#### Impact

- ✅ Synchronized data across views
- ✅ Accurate success metrics
- ✅ Cleaner and maintainable state flow

---

### 3. Interface Mismatch

**File**: `lead-store.ts`  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem

Missing `industry` field in the Lead interface led to data being silently dropped.

#### Root Cause

Interface was not updated to match the frontend form structure.

#### Fix

Added the missing `industry` property to the Lead interface.

#### Impact

- ✅ Type-safe data handling
- ✅ No data loss
- ✅ Interface and form now aligned

## Major Fixes Implemented

### 4. Missing Database Persistence

**File**: `LeadCaptureForm.tsx`  
**Severity**: Major  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem

Form data was stored only locally and not persisted to the backend.

#### Root Cause

No Supabase insert function was called after form submission.

#### Fix

Integrated Supabase insert logic following successful submission.

#### Impact

- ✅ Permanent data storage
- ✅ Data now survives reloads
- ✅ Backend is now correctly updated

---

## Minor Fixes Implemented

### 5. Unused useEffect

**File**: `LeadCaptureForm.tsx` (lines 17–19)  
**Severity**: Minor  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem

Redundant `useEffect` resetting state unnecessarily on mount.

#### Root Cause

Leftover logic from an outdated state handling pattern.

#### Fix

Removed the unnecessary `useEffect` block.

#### Impact

- ✅ Cleaner lifecycle methods
- ✅ Reduced unnecessary renders
- ✅ Simpler component logic
